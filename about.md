## Quzgen.musicTheoryPractice.net

A light utility for generating quizes

QuizGen.MusicTheoryPractice.Net is a <a href="">Free as in Coffee</a> utility.
Our intent is to make a useful tool for music and music theory teachers to be able to quickly generate printable quizes for their students.

Check out our full range of quiz types in the menu or on <a href="/newQuiz.html">Generate New Quiz</a>.

### Free as in Coffee
That is, completely free to use. I'm not going to say "no" to some coffee money, though.

### Dependencies/Thank you's
This project would not have been possible without these awesome open source or free projects and libraries.
